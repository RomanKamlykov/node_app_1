2. Install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
3. Change the "api" variable at the "public/services.js" file to production
4. Initialize git, commit the files, except the ".env" file and the "node_modules" folder
5. Run commands "heroku login", "heroku create", "heroku git:remote -a <APP_NAME>", "git push heroku master"
6. Open the heroku app at https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps, add "Config Vars" from the ".env" file

## Application structure
- the "index.js" file is an entry point of the application
- the application api has two routes: "search" and "upload"
- the "upload" route uses the "multer" middleware and the "exceljs" package to get data from an excel file, after that it saves the data in the MongoDB database
- the "search" route queries data from the MongoDB database and sends it to the client
